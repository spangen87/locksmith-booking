### Agile Methodology
#### GitHub Project Board
I this project I used GitHubs project board to keep track of my user stories. This was helpful for a bigger project like this so i could break down every user story to smaller pieces,
and keep track of what is left. It was also helpful for morale. It feels good to move the stories across the board, especially when you feel a little stuck. Using the labels helped to decide where to start each day.
This project is done by my self alone, but I understand that this tool would be even more important when there is more devolopers working on the same project.
